The goal was to create an intuitive, flexible tool that provides users with various options to <highlight-text>generate perfect mazes</highlight-text>, where every open space is accessible.<br><br>I developed this project independently over the course of one week as part of a <highlight-text>trial assignment for a potential internship at DTT</highlight-text>. It required a strong understanding of algorithms and grid systems. The development process involved not only programming but also debugging, optimizing performance for larger mazes, and ensuring the user interface was intuitive for testing different configurations.",

This score reflects solid work but also highlights areas for improvement, such as refining my approach to code documentation and enhancing the error-catching and handling aspects of the project. Despite this, the experience was a valuable learning opportunity. It allowed me to sharpen my skills in Unity development and algorithm design, providing insights that will inform my approach to future projects.",

There are many possible reasons for this. At the time, the overall skill level of the class wasnâ€™t particularly high. Most students were unable to create even a 20 by 20 maze. For those who could, their implementations often failed to meet the 250 by 250 cell requirement due to poor data structure choices and a lack of algorithm knowledge.",

One key issue was that my program allowed users to input negative numbers, which caused errors and impacted my marks. Additionally, my code documentation was not as detailed as expected. While it covered the basics, it didnâ€™t go in-depth as it should have. Another area of improvement was inheritance and abstraction. While I used inheritance, it was limited to the two different algorithms, and the abstract generator class could have been broken into smaller, more modular components for better structure. Lastly, the user experience could have been improved. The user interface lacked feedback, such as animations or sound effects when interacting with buttons. While I did include audio (which could be muted), it didnâ€™t add much to the overall experience.<br><br>In summary, while I was able to complete the project and demonstrate my capabilities, the shortcomings in input validation, documentation, inheritance, and user experience were significant enough to impact my score and the final decision. Nonetheless, this experience taught me important lessons that I will carry forward into future projects.",
