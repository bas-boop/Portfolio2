    description: "This project is a grid-based maze generator created in Unity, designed to give users full control over maze generation. Key customizable parameters include the size of the maze and the choice of algorithm for generating it, such as Prim's or the recursive backtracking method. The goal was to create an intuitive, flexible tool that provides users with various options to generate perfect mazes, where every open space is accessible.<br><br>I developed this project independently over the course of one week as part of a trial assignment for a potential internship at DTT. It required a strong understanding of algorithms and grid systems. The development process involved not only programming but also debugging, optimizing performance for larger mazes, and ensuring the user interface was intuitive for testing different configurations.",

            description: "Although I wasn't selected for the internship, mainly due to the high volume of applicants, I received a grade of 7.1/10 for my efforts. This score reflects solid work but also highlights areas where I could improve, such as refining my approach to code documentation and enhancing the error-catching and handling aspects of the project. The experience was a valuable learning opportunity that helped me sharpen my skills in Unity development and algorithm design, and it will inform my approach to future projects.",
