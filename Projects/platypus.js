    description: "Platypus is a passion project of mine—a platformer featuring innovative movement options. At my own pace, I developed several in-depth features, including a state machine, a pickup system with delivery functionality, a ground checker, and various smaller components for the game loop. Originally created for my portfolio in 2022, this project showcases my skills and ambitions.<br><br>Throughout the development process, I engaged heavily in programming as well as art creation. I have a particular fondness for pixel art, and I’m pleased with how the player character turned out, complete with amusing animations. Additionally, I experimented with integrating shaders using the Universal Render Pipeline (URP), such as an outline shader for the entities.",

            description: "As I mentioned earlier, Platypus was developed in 2022 for my portfolio. At that time, I successfully showcased my skills, which have since evolved and improved. I had ambitious plans for the game, including level designs focused on time-based or collection-based gameplay, as well as a small narrative featuring a parent platypus gathering food and defending its eggs from predators.<br><br>I would love to revisit this project, but I recognize that I would need to start from scratch, as the fundamentals are flawed in many ways. I created a mock-up for the level featuring the platypus, which I now use as my Discord profile picture. It serves as a constant reminder of my aspirations for the future. Perhaps one day, I’ll create my own company and bring this game to life.",
