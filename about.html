                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>My name is Bas de Reus and I am <span id="age"></span> years old. I am a game developer living in Zaandam, the Netherlands. I already have <span id="experience"></span> years of experience in programming and making games.<br><br>
                    At the moment I'm attending <a href="https://www.hku.nl/" class="link">HKU</a> for a <highlight-text>Bachelor of Creative Media and Game Technologies</highlight-text>, currently in year <span id="hku"></span>. Already have a <a href="https://www.ma-web.nl/" class="link">MBO</a> diploma for software development focused on game development.

                <h2>Why I Make Games</h2>
                <p>
                    I enjoy creating games because I want to give others the same sense of enjoyment that games have given me. This passion is why I became a game developer. I particularly enjoy working on gameplay features and systems.
                    <br><br>I have extensive experience with Unity and C#, as shown on the <a href="index" class="link">home page</a>, but I am also broadening my skills by exploring other game engines like <a href="https://godotengine.org/" class="link">Godot</a>. In addition to development, I enjoy taking on leadership roles in projects. I have frequently served as a <highlight-text>Lead Developer</highlight-text> or <highlight-text>Scrum Master</highlight-text>.

                <h2>Looking for an Internship</h2>
                <p>As I continue my Bachelor of Creative Media and Game Technologies at HKU, <highlight-text>I’m seeking an internship</highlight-text> with a game development company where I can further develop my skills in building gameplay and developer features, just like my <a href="/Projects/CaptureGraafsmeer#Photobook-Custom-Window" class="link">custom window</a>. With a strong foundation in Unity and C# from my MBO diploma, I’m excited to bring my experience to a professional team focused on creating engaging, high-quality games.
                    <br><br>I am especially interested in gaining hands-on experience with development deadlines. While I have extensive experience in programming and project development, I’m eager to grow my skills in navigating the fast-paced, deadline-driven environments of the industry. <highlight-text>Working with real timelines and milestones</highlight-text> will be an invaluable learning experience, and I am excited to adapt and meet the expectations that come with professional game development.
                    <br><br>While Unity is my primary tool, I am open to working with other engines and frameworks like Godot, Unreal, or MonoGame to broaden my expertise and learn new technologies. If you’re looking for an <highlight-text>intern who is dedicated, passionate, and ready to grow</highlight-text>, I’d love to <a href="contact" class="link">connect</a>!

                <h2>Gaming</h2>
                <p>
                    As a game developer, it's no surprise that I also enjoy playing games. Lately, I've been playing a bit less because I find making games even more fun. I've been gaming since childhood, starting with my <highlight-text>DS and Wii</highlight-text>. Nowadays, I primarily play on my PC and Nintendo Switch.<br><br>

I tend to gravitate towards building and simulation games, like <highlight-text>Cities: Skylines</highlight-text>, based on my playtime. However, I also enjoy competitive games like <highlight-text>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</highlight-text> and <highlight-text>Rainbow Six Siege</highlight-text>.

                <h2>Public Appearances</h2>
                <p>On occasion, you’ll find me in a suit, whether I’m attending an event or delivering a speech on stage.<br><br>
                    During the 2023-2024 academic year, which was my final exam year for my MBO study, I had the honor of speaking at the official opening ceremony. You can check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bas-de-reus_xr-hololens-mbo-activity-7107302399190413312-Glsz" class="link">LinkedIn post</a> for more details.<br><br>
                    I also spoke on stage with a former colleague during the <highlight-text>XR Innovation Showcases</highlight-text>, where we highlighted new projects and prototypes. You can see a recap of the event in this <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bas-de-reus_aftermovie-xr-innovation-showcases-bekijk-activity-7144137402851196928-Rram" class="link">LinkedIn post</a>, where I speak first in the video.</p>
