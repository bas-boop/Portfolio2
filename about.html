                <h2>Introductie</h2>
                <p>My name is Bas de Reus and I am <span id="age"></span> years old.<br>
                    I am a game developer living in Zaandam, the Netherlands.<br>
                    I have <span id="experience"></span> years of experience in programming.<br>
                    At the moment I'm attending <a href="https://www.hku.nl/" class="link">HKU</a> for a <highlight-text>Bachelor of Creative Media and Game Technologies</highlight-text>, currently in year <span id="hku"></span>.<br>
                    Already have a <a href="https://www.ma-web.nl/" class="link">MBO</a> diploma for software development focused on game development.

                <h2>Why I Make Games</h2>
                <p>I like to make games because I want to be able to give the enjoyment that games gave me to others.<br>
                    This is why I am a game developer. I do like to work on gameplay features and systems.<br>
                    I have the most experience with Unity and C#, which can be found on the <a href="index.html" class="link">home page</a>.<br>
                    What I also like to do is take the lead in projects. I have often done this in the role of lead developer or scrum master.</p>

                <h2>Gaming</h2>
                <p>Of course, as a game developer, I also play games.<br>
                    At the moment, I play a little less because I find making games much more fun.<br>
                    I've been gaming since I was a kid, when I mostly played on my DS and Wii.<br>
                    These days I mostly play on my PC and Switch.<br>
                    I like building and simulation genres, according to my playtime.<br>
                    But I also enjoy a competitive game every now and then.</p>
