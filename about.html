                <p>My name is Bas de Reus and I am <span id="age"></span> years old. I am a game developer living in Zaandam, the Netherlands. I already have <span id="experience"></span> years of experience in programming and making games.<br><br>
                    At the moment I'm attending <a href="https://www.hku.nl/" target="_blank" class="link">HKU</a> for a <highlight-text>Bachelor of Creative Media and Game Technologies</highlight-text>, currently in year <span id="hku"></span>.

                <h2>Why I Make Games</h2>
                <p>
                    I enjoy creating games because I want to give others the same sense of enjoyment that games have given me. This passion is why I became a game developer. I particularly enjoy working on gameplay features and systems.
                    <br><br>I have extensive experience with Unity and C#, as shown on the <a href="index" class="link">home page</a>, but I am also broadening my skills by exploring other game engines like <custom-tooltip tooltip="Godot Engine, the free and open source community-driven 2D and 3D game engine!">Godot</custom-tooltip>. In addition to development, I enjoy taking on leadership roles in projects. I have frequently served as a <highlight-text>Lead Developer</highlight-text> or <highlight-text>Scrum Master</highlight-text>.

                <h2>Looking for an Internship</h2>
                <p>As I continue my Bachelor of Creative Media and Game Technologies at HKU, <highlight-text>I’m seeking an internship</highlight-text> with a game development company where I can further develop my skills in building gameplay and developer features, just like my <a href="/Projects/CaptureGraafsmeer#Photobook-Custom-Window" class="link">custom window</a>. With a strong foundation in Unity and C# from my MBO diploma and 2 additional years at HKU, I’m excited to bring my experience to a professional team focused on creating engaging, high-quality games.
                    <br><br>I am especially interested in gaining hands-on experience with development deadlines. While I have extensive experience in programming and project development, I’m eager to grow my skills in navigating the fast-paced, deadline-driven environments of the industry. <highlight-text>Working with real timelines and milestones</highlight-text> will be an invaluable learning experience, and I am excited to adapt and meet the expectations that come with professional game development.
                    <br><br>While Unity is my primary tool, I am open to working with other engines and frameworks like Godot, Unreal, or MonoGame to broaden my expertise and learn new technologies. If you’re looking for an <highlight-text>intern who is dedicated, passionate, and ready to grow</highlight-text>, I’d love to <a href="contact" class="link">connect</a>!

                <h2>Gaming</h2>
                <p>
                    As a game developer, it's no surprise that I also enjoy playing games. Lately, I've been playing a bit less because I find making games even more fun. I've been gaming since childhood, starting with my <highlight-text>DS and Wii</highlight-text>. Nowadays, I primarily play on my PC and Nintendo Switch.<br><br>

I tend to gravitate towards building and simulation games, like <highlight-text>Cities: Skylines</highlight-text>, based on my playtime. However, I also enjoy competitive games like <highlight-text>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</highlight-text> and <highlight-text>Rainbow Six Siege</highlight-text>.

                    During the 2023-2024 academic year, which was my final exam year for my MBO study, I had the honor of speaking at the official opening ceremony.

We aimed to make this project as polished as possible with our knowledge at the time. While the gameplay is simple, it felt like a significant achievement back then. My contributions included developing core mechanics such as player stats, a pick-up system for collecting eggs, a key-and-door system, and the main menu.</p>

During this experience, I began to fully understand the tools and techniques I was using. Previously, my approach was to make things work and move on; here, I learned to make things work and improve them—whether through cleaner code, better gameplay, or enhanced visuals. Much of what I do today stems from what I learned during this time.</p>

                    <p>While organizing my own game jam was a fun experience, it was a lot to manage. So, I decided to join a public game jam on itch.io: the Wanna x Yam Game Jam 2022. The theme was "Combination," which inspired me to brainstorm ideas. I landed on the concept of colors and decided to create an educational game about mixing colors. To make it engaging, I added levels and a timer to create a complete gameplay experience.</p>

                    <p>My first internship in game development was at XR-Lab, where we focused on XR projects using technologies like virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR). I worked on two key projects: a VR karaoke game for the TV network AVROTROS, translating their show <custom-tooltip tooltip="Each episode the singer will cover their own songs and sing for each other.">"Beste Zangers"</custom-tooltip> into an immersive VR environment, and an AR reimagination of an existing app/web app for the client Gpal.

                    <p>Game jams are an absolute favorite of mine, and I might have joined a few too many during the summer of 2023! I participated in three, in this order: GMTK 2023 (the biggest jam of the year), Do You WANNA Jam?! 2023, and Brackeys Game Jam 2023.2. Each of these jams was a collaborative effort with many of my friends—some joined me for multiple jams, and a few were there for all three. Here's what we created: a small blacksmith simulator, a horror game featuring a monster, and a roguelike about eyes and the mind.</p>

I worked on creating software for simulations, including one focused on logistics and another on pedestrian walking. This experience felt more like a traditional office job, and it was a great opportunity to learn about working culture and the simulation industry. I gained valuable insights into both the technical and professional aspects of development.</p>
